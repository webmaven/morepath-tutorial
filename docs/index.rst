Welcome to 'Morepath by Example'
================================

You want to develop an application with Python and Morepath? Here you have the
chance to learn that by example. In this tutorial we will create a simple
microblog application. It only supports one user that can create text-only
entries and there are no feeds or comments, but it still features everything
you need to get started. We will use Morepath as our framework and SQLite as 
our database which comes out of the box with Python, so there is nothing else
you need.

If you want the full source code in advance or for comparison, check out the
